README

This is a program which demonstrates implementation of QuickSort and BinarySearch algorithms.
The program make an array with given array size.
The array size user intups from terminal.
The BInarySearch algorithm was implemented correspondingly by two recursive and Iterative ways.
The program also checks for dangerous values during search.
The program also checks is the array ordered by monoton order.
For building program user must run makefile by this way.
make
For ranning program user must type following
java Main
for clearing program user must run make whith clear command line parameter by this way
make clear.

Thank you.
